# Favorite Programming Language
This project is a clone of Miguel Grinberg's [favorite programming language project](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-pycon2015).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to see how long it takes me to finish this project under the condition of me feeling like I've already known how to do it.

I will also write to a NOTE.md file recording the progress.

Hopefully, I can finish it no matter what. I'm a little uncertain right now.
